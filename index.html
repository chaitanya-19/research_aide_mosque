                2] The news titled “Mosque, Arizona Immigration Controversies Reflect Tough Economy” was published on oct 12 2010.The
                article connects economic hardship to racial intolerance in America, where people take out their frustrations on
                minorities, such as Muslims and Latinos, during tough times. The author mentions the controversy surrounding mosque
                construction near Ground Zero and similar protests across the country. The author also discusses recent court decisions
                on immigration and gay marriage and their impact on the march to equality, but acknowledges that some Americans are
                frustrated with their financial situation and feel ignored.

                <p style="color:rgb(30, 32, 37);"> 1] One of the earliest mentions of muslims in phoenix came this year in form of a scholarly article “Muslim
                American/American Muslim Identity: Authoring Self in Post-9/11 America” which was published on oct 20 2011. <br><br>
                2] The article studies how Muslim American identity is formed in Phoenix, Arizona, through the experiences of immigrant and
                American-born Muslims. It analyzes the self-image and representations of Muslims in a discursive contact zone where
                America and Islam converge. Three themes emerge: Muslims see their Islam as "more authentic," fear their faith is under
                attack, and the meaning of the label "American Muslim/Muslim American" is not yet established.

                converts and immigrants on their roles in forming an American Muslim community and their views on identity, cultural
                Islam, and the Islamization of America. Using participant observation, interviews, and surveys, the study looks at how
                these individuals define themselves and their community, and how their faith affects their daily lives and future plans.
                The study takes place in the Phoenix and Chicago metropolitan areas.
